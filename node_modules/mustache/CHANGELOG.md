# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [3.2.1] / 30 December 2019

### Fixed

 * [#733]: Allow the CLI to use JavaScript views when the project has ES6 modules enabled, by [@eobrain].

## [3.2.0] / 18 December 2019

### Added

* [#728]: Expose ECMAScript Module in addition to UMD (CommonJS, AMD & global scope), by [@phillipj] and [@zekth].

### Using mustache.js as an ES module

To stay backwards compatible with already using projects, the default exposed module format is still UMD.
That means projects using mustache.js as an CommonJS, AMD or global scope module, from npm or directly from github.com
can keep on doing that for now.

For those projects who would rather want to use mustache.js as an ES module, the `mustache/mustache.mjs` file has to
be `import`ed directly.

Below are some usage scenarios for different runtimes.

#### Modern browser with ES module support

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script type="module">
  import mustache from "https://unpkg.com/mustache@3.2.0/mustache.mjs"

  console.log(mustache.render('Hello {{name}}!', { name: 'Santa' }))
  // Hello Santa!
</script>
```

#### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>= v13.2.0 or using --experimental-modules flag)

```js
// index.mjs
import mustache from 'mustache/mustache.mjs'

console.log(mustache.render('Hello {{name}}!', { name: 'Santa' }))
// Hello Santa!
```

ES Module support for Node.js will be improved in the future when [Conditional Exports](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_conditional_exports)
is enabled by default rather than being behind an experimental flag.

More info in [Node.js ECMAScript Modules docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html).

#### [Deno](https://deno.land/)

```js
// index.ts
import mustache from 'https://unpkg.com/mustache@3.2.0/mustache.mjs'

console.log(mustache.render('Hello {{name}}!', { name: 'Santa' }))
// Hello Santa!
```

## [3.0.1] / 11 November 2018

 * [#679]: Fix partials not rendering tokens when using custom tags, by [@stackchain].

## [3.0.0] / 16 September 2018

We are very happy to announce a new major version of mustache.js. We want to be very careful not to break projects
out in the wild, and adhering to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) we have therefore cut this new major version.

The changes introduced will likely not require any actions for most using projects. The things to look out for that
might cause unexpected rendering results are described in the migration guide below.

A big shout out and thanks to [@raymond-lam] for this release! Without his contributions with code and issue triaging,
this release would never have happened.

### Major

* [#618]: Allow rendering properties of primitive types that are not objects, by [@raymond-lam].
* [#643]: `Writer.prototype.parse` to cache by tags in addition to template string, by [@raymond-lam].
* [#664]: Fix `Writer.prototype.parse` cache, by [@seminaoki].

### Minor

* [#673]: Add `tags` parameter to `Mustache.render()`, by [@raymond-lam].

### Migrating from mustache.js v2.x to v3.x

#### Rendering properties of primitive types

We have ensured properties of primitive types can be rendered at all times. That means `Array.length`, `String.length`
and similar. A corner case where this could cause unexpected output follows:

View:
```
{
  stooges: [
    { name: "Moe" },
    { name: "Larry" },
    { name: "Curly" }
  ]
}
```

Template:
```
{{#stooges}}
  {{name}}: {{name.length}} characters
{{/stooges}}
```

Output with v3.0:
```
  Moe: 3 characters
  Larry: 5 characters
  Curly: 5 characters
```

Output with v2.x:
```
  Moe:  characters
  Larry:  characters
  Curly:  characters
```

#### Caching for templates with custom delimiters

We have improved the templates cache to ensure custom delimiters are taken into consideration for the cache.
This improvement might cause unexpected rendering behaviour for using projects actively using the custom delimiters functionality.

Previously it was possible to use `Mustache.parse()` as a means to set global custom delimiters. If custom
delimiters were provided as an argument, it would affect all following calls to `Mustache.render()`.
Consider the following:

```js
const template = "[[item.title]] [[item.value]]";
mustache.parse(template, ["[[", "]]"]);

console.log(
  mustache.render(template, {
    item: {
      title: "TEST",
      value: 1
    }
  })
);

>> TEST 1
```

The above illustrates the fact that `Mustache.parse()` made mustache.js cache the template without considering
the custom delimiters provided. This is no longer true.

We no longer encourage using `Mustache.parse()` for this purpose, but have rather added a fourth argument to
`Mustache.render()` letting you provide custom delimiters when rendering.

If you still need the pre-parse the template and use custom delimiters at the same time, ensure to provide
the custom delimiters as argument to `Mustache.render()` as well.
